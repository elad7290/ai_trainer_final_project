# AI Trainer Project

The goal of our project is to make the subject of physical activity accessible to the general
public in a technological way.
We believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and want to make others understand the
importance of training and make them start training without excuses of lack of knowledge.
Our application gives virtual support in everything related to physical activity without an
active human factor.
